# Introduction

Welcome to Mario Finance! If this is your first time here, please take some time to read through this documentation before you begin using the protocol. This documentation is intended to take you through the entire process of how to get started using Mario Finance to earn stable, high yields that are only possible through the power of DeFi, but with the stability and security of exposure to Bitcoin, the world's largest and most stable crypto asset. Let's dive in!

## Origins

Mario Finance is based upon the work of the brilliant **tomb.finance** project on the Fantom network. At the time, it was hard to believe that nothing similar existed on any other larger networks, so it was a great opportunity to bring an amazingly stable and robust DeFi protocol like **tomb.finance** with a few unique twists to the masses. \
\
This project would certainly not be possible without the work of the [tomb.finance](https://tomb.finance) team. Their project being fully open source and developed exceptionally well made it a pleasure to work with, and we would not be here today without their efforts, so we want to give a special thank you to them for that.

## Ther Big Picture

The $MARIO algorithmic token serves as the backbone of a rapidly growing ecosystem aimed towards bringing liquidity and new use cases to the Opera network.

The protocol's underlying mechanism dynamically adjusts $MARIO's supply, pushing its price up or down relative to the price of $FTM.\
\
Inspired by the original idea behind Basis as well as its predecessors (bDollar and soup), Mario.finance is a multi-token protocol which consists of the following three tokens:\
-Mario ($MARIO). \
-Mario Shares ($BOWSER). \
-Mario Bonds ($LUIGI).

## What's the point?

Unlike previous algorithmic tokens, $MARIO is not pegged to a stable coinâ€” it is instead pegged to $FTM. 

Why is this?

Mario.Finance believes in the potential of Fantom Opera, and has chosen to align its mission to both provide value to and derive value from $FTM's future growth. In addition to existing and future use cases such as FTMPad, $MARIO aims to become the main medium of exchange on Fantom Opera: this will be achieved by providing a mirrored, liquid asset to $FTM. 
One of the primary shortcomings of past algorithmic tokens has been a lack of use cases, leaving no good reason for somebody to want to use or hold them. In order to successfully maintain the peg in the long-run, the Mario team will maintain a focus on innovation around enhanced functionality and use cases.

MARIO is the native token of the Mario Finance protocol. The built-in stability mechanisms within the protocol aim to maintain MARIO's peg of 1 MARIO = 1 FTM in the long run.
