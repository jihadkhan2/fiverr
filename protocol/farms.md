![The Mario Finance farms currently available for staking LP tokens to earn BSHARE rewards](../.gitbook/assets/Farms.png)

To incentivize healthy liquidity pools for the Mario Finance protocol tokens, our LP farms have been seeded with BSHARE to be distributed as rewards to LP stakers across a time period of 12 months. The total BSHARE rewards are distributed from each farm as follows:

* MARIO-BTCB LP: 25% of BSHARE rewards
* BSHARE-BNB LP: 25% of BSHARE rewards
* MARIO Single Stake: 50% of BSHARE rewards
* ~~MARIO-BSHARE LP: _Deprecated_~~

### **1. What will happen when the circulating supply equals the total supply? Will reward emissions stop?**

Yes. Once the max supply of BSHARE (59.5K) is reached, reward emissions end. This will happen in exactly one year from when the BSHARE farms started on November 25th, 2021. BSHARE will always continue to print MARIO in the Boardroom, though, as long as MARIO remains above peg.

BSHARE reward emissions for the current LP farms are scheduled to end on November 25th, 2022 once the total BSHARE supply has been distributed.

### 2. Why is "at-peg" (TWAP between 1.00 and 1.01) the best time to provide liquidity?

When MARIO is pegged or close to being pegged at 10,000 MARIO to 1 BTC, it is more akin to having exposure to a single asset (single staking) than to your traditional LP'ing experience, where you would run the risk of impermanent loss if one of the tokens went up in value and the other did not.

### 3. Wait, you mean that if BTC pumps, MARIO pumps with it?

**Yes!**\
\
Let's look at an example:\
\
If BTC pumps in price, it won't "outrun" MARIO, even if nobody is buying MARIO at that time.\
\
The farm APRs will vary in terms of USD value, but the emissions won’t. This is something that wouldn't be possible with another 1:1 pegged asset like a stablecoin LP position, where the USD value is directly tied to the emissions. If BTC rises in USD value, MARIO goes with it. Similarly, if BTC falls in USD value, MARIO will be worth less in USD, **but it won’t affect the peg**.

{% hint style="info" %}
The only thing that can change the price of MARIO in terms of its BTC value (and as such, the peg) is buying and selling it.
